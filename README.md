Visit two kinds of job sites as part of your research. Job listing sites such as Dice (which specializes in technology-related career listings), Indeed, and Monster (general job listing sites) enable you to see what kinds of jobs are currently in demand. Review sites such as Glassdoor discuss working conditions, salaries, bonuses, perks, and other informa- tion useful for finding the right kind of company for you.

No contracts and no offshore


Another way to make yourself more difficult to replace is to acquire domain specific knowledge: expertise related to the programs you write but outside of the field of programming. For example, if you develop financial software, it’s much more difficult to out- source your job if it involves the application of accounting skills in addition to programming than if you’re purely a coder.

develop marketable skills

* participating in programming contests
* proffeesional development courses - coursera, etc
* master or doctorate degree
* don't bother with certifications
* work on side project , or open source development
* Use code contest sites. TopCoder, HackerRank, CodeWars, and several similar sites have developers “face-off” to solve programming problems. If you win, meaning you solve the problem faster than the competitor or bot, you move up the leaderboards and get a higher rank, which you can make public and list on your résumé.

Companies look for software developers who get things done. You may look great on paper in terms of skills and education, but credentials and knowledge don’t make products or services that a company can sell. It’s your ability to accomplish something that truly sets you apart from the other candidates.

Your online profile—everything public about you online—is just as important as your résumé. Recruiters use online profiles to find desirable candidates

* Google search results for your name. This is the first impression you make on potential employers and colleagues.
* LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn is a social network for tracking professional connections. It’s free to join, and you can create a detailed profile about yourself, including your jobs and your education—essentially an online résumé. Colleagues and customers can publicly endorse you or your work, which can be quite valuable.
* GitHub profile. Many employers will evaluate your work through your GitHub profile well before they meet you. Take a look and spend a few hours to clean up your GitHub profile so it reflects your best code. Delete or change the privacy settings for incomplete, poorly orga- nized, or low-quality repositories. Assume your profile may be checked even before you’re asked about it. If you don’t have very much public, move your best code to public so it’s clear that you have significant code and experience with GitHub.
* Stack Overflow. This will show up on your Google search result, or may be checked. If you have recent, basic questions that reflect poorly on your knowledge, you may want to delete them. If you don’t have a profile, you should make one, especially if your job search is still a few months out and you have time to answer other people’s questions.
* Angel investor sites. These sites don’t just connect investors with startups, they also connect startups with potential hires. AngelList is the big player in this category. Create a profile that reflects your interests and expertise.
* Other social network profiles. Other social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat may be reviewed, depending on your privacy settings. Make sure you clean up and tighten your profile so nothing unprofessional appears public.
* Personal website. This is a potential source of more in-depth information about you and top- ics you find interesting. If you blog about political or controversial topics, you may want to remove such posts during your job search.
* Articles and blog posts. If you write about programming-related topics, this is a good way for recruiters to assess your experience.
* Comments and forum posts. These provide another way to gain some insight into your pro- gramming skills and your general attitude toward technology and technology companies.
